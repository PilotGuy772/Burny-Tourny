<p>We make dumb shit to do the teams yay</p>

<h3>What dis for?</h3>

Well, this program was created for the express purpose of running tournaments for the one and only General Burnout
Created by the beloved nerds PilotGuy772, Red The Arcstrider, and maybe headassbtw

<h3>Install and Use</h3>

Is your brain rather small? Do you want to use this program? Well you're in luck!

Super simple. Just download the files and find `Burny Tourny.exe` in `\bin`. Run the `.exe`.
If your computer gets angy, tell it to shut up. This aint a virus. 

To use it, simply follow the instructions. If you can't figure it out, that's not my problem.

<h3>Live Mode Commands</h3>

There currently isn't a help command in live mode so this will do until then. 

```
match     | Creates a new match
list      | Lists active match
remove    | Gracelessly deletes a match fromm the DB
finish    | Finishes an active match and uses a wizard to give points
award     | Directly give points to a team
quit      | bye-bye. quitting live mode doesn't lose you any data.
```

<h5>remember</h5>

This program is meant to be used for a very specific event in [General Burnout's](https://www.twitch.tv/generalburnout "The coolest fire man on Twitch") discord server. Probably not something anyone execept us will ever need.
